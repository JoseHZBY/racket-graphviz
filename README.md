# Racket GraphViz Integration

The goal of this library is to make composition of Racket [Pict](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pict/)
and [Graphviz Diagrams](https://www.graphviz.org/) possible.

The composition is made possible through:
* You can use graphviz diagrams as normal picts
* You can use any Pict as node shape of graphviz diagrams
